The count of color 3 is 13, color 6 is 21, and color 8 is 8. The output is a 1x1 grid containing color 6.\\n2. **Observation example #2:** The input grid is 6x7. It contains cells of color 3, 6, and 8. The count of color 3 is 10, color 6 is 24, and color 8 is 8. The output is a 1x1 grid containing color 3.\\n3. **Observation example #3:** The input grid is 6x6. It contains cells of color 3, 6, and 8. The count of color 3 is 11, color 6 is 17, and color 8 is 8. The output is a 1x1 grid containing color 6.\\n4. **Observation example #4:** The input grid is 5x7. It contains cells of color 3, 6, and 8. The count of color 3 is 9, color 6 is 18, and color 8 is 8. The output is a 1x1 grid containing color 3.\\n5. **Observation example #5:** The input grid is 6x7. It contains cells of color 3, 6, and 8. The count of color 3 is 14, color 6 is 20, and color 8 is 8. The output is a 1x1 grid containing color 3.\\n6. **Observation example #6:** The input grid is 5x5. It contains cells of color 3, 6, and 8. The count of color 3 is 6, color 6 is 11, and color 8 is 8. The output is a 1x1 grid containing color 6.\\n7. **Relationship analysis:** Across all examples, the output is consistently a 1x1 grid containing either color 3 or color 6. Color 8 (Light Blue) is always present in the input grids with a count of 8 cells, but it never appears in the output. The grid dimensions of the input vary, but the output size is fixed at 1x1. A pattern emerges when observing the parity (even or odd) of the count of color 6 (Magenta). For example #1, the count of 6 is 21 (odd), and the output is 6. For example #2, the count of 6 is 24 (even), and the output is 3. This pattern holds for all examples: if the count of color 6 is odd, the output is 6; if the count of color 6 is even, the output is 3. The count of color 3 and color 8, and the grid dimensions, do not appear to directly influence the output color beyond the parity of color 6.\\n8. **Apply to test input (representative mapping):** To apply this rule to the test input, I will first count all occurrences of color 6 (Magenta). The test input grid is:\\n[[6, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6],\\n [6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 8],\\n [6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8],\\n [6, 3, 6, 6, 6, 3],\\n [6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6],\\n [3, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3],\\n [6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6],\\n [6, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6]]\\nCounting the occurrences of color 6:\\n- Row 0: 5 occurrences (at columns 0, 2, 3, 4, 5)\\n- Row 1: 3 occurrences (at columns 0, 1, 2)\\n- Row 2: 1 occurrence (at column 0)\\n- Row 3: 4 occurrences (at columns 0, 2, 3, 4)\\n- Row 4: 5 occurrences (at columns 0, 1, 2, 4, 5)\\n- Row 5: 2 occurrences (at columns 3, 4)\\n- Row 6: 4 occurrences (at columns 0, 3, 4, 5)\\n- Row 7: 3 occurrences (at columns 0, 2, 5)\\nSumming these counts: 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 27. The total count of color 6 in the test input is 27. Since 27 is an odd number, the rule dictates that the output color should be 6.\\n9. **Verification approach & confidence:** To verify the predicted output, I would re-count the occurrences of color 6 in the test input grid to ensure accuracy. If the count is indeed 27, then applying the inferred rule (odd count of 6 leads to output 6) directly confirms the predicted output of [[6]]. I am highly confident in this rule as it consistently explains all provided example input-output pairs without any contradictions.\",\n",

Let (R_in_BB, C_in_BB) be the top-left coordinate of this bounding box.\\n- All output grids form a specific 5x5 'diamond' pattern of non-7 cells, always containing 13 cells. Let (R_out_BB, C_out_BB) be the top-left coordinate of this output pattern.\\n- The core transformation involves a shift of the pattern and a filling process:\\n    a. **Determining the shift (dr, dc):** The shift applied to the input pattern to determine the placement of the output pattern's top-left corner (R_out_BB, C_out_BB) from the input pattern's top-left bounding box corner (R_in_BB, C_in_BB) is calculated as: \\n        - If R_in_BB is 2 and C_in_BB is 3 (Example 1), then (dr, dc) = (0, -1).\\n        - If R_in_BB is 2 and C_in_BB is 4 (Example 2), then (dr, dc) = (-1, -2).\\n        - If R_in_BB is 3 and C_in_BB is 4 (Example 3), then (dr, dc) = (-2, -1).\\n        This pattern suggests that `dr = -(R_in_BB - 2)` and `dc = -(C_in_BB - 3) - (R_in_BB == 2 and C_in_BB == 4)` if generalized. A simpler approach is to generalize: `dr = 0` if `R_in_BB = 2` and `C_in_BB = 3`; `dr = -1` if `R_in_BB = 2` and `C_in_BB = 4`; `dr = -2` if `R_in_BB = 3`. Similarly for `dc`. Given the pattern of shifts (0,-1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1), it appears `dr = (2 - R_in_BB)` and `dc = (2 - C_in_BB)` if `R_in_BB` is 2 and `C_in_BB` is 3, else `dc = (3 - C_in_BB) - 1`. A more consistent rule that covers all examples is: `dr = (2 - R_in_BB)` and `dc = (3 - C_in_BB) - 1` if `(R_in_BB, C_in_BB)` is `(2,3)`, else `dc = (2 - C_in_BB) - 1` if `(R_in_BB, C_in_BB)` is `(2,4)`, else `dc = (3 - C_in_BB) - 1`. This rule is still difficult to generalize as a simple formula. A more robust observation is that the output pattern's top-left (R_out_BB, C_out_BB) is chosen to be as high and as left as possible, but specifically:\\n            - `R_out_BB` is 1 if `R_in_BB` is 2 and `C_in_BB` is 4, or if `R_in_BB` is 3. Otherwise, `R_out_BB` is 2.\\n            - `C_out_BB` is 2 if `C_in_BB` is 3 or 4 (and `R_in_BB` is 2). Otherwise, `C_out_BB` is 3 (if `R_in_BB` is 3 and `C_in_BB` is 4).\\n        This implies specific destination coordinates for the output pattern based on input. For new inputs, we can assume a consistent up/left shift behavior.\\n        A simpler, generalized shift for the bounding box center (`R_center_in = R_in_BB + 2`, `C_center_in = C_in_BB + 2`) to (`R_center_out = R_out_BB + 2`, `C_center_out = C_out_BB + 2`): the observed shifts `(R_center_out - R_center_in, C_center_out - C_center_in)` are `(0, -1)`, `(-1, -2)`, `(-2, -1)`. The shift to apply to all individual cells from input (r,c) to output (r+dr, c+dc) is this `(dr, dc)`. For the test input, we will infer the `(dr, dc)` from the pattern.\\n    b. **Color assignment:** \\n        i. Initialize the output grid with all 7s.\\n        ii. For each non-7 cell `(r_in, c_in)` in the input grid, its color `input_grid[r_in][c_in]` is copied to `output_grid[r_in + dr][c_in + dc]`.\\n        iii. The 5x5 diamond output pattern has 13 positions. Any of these 13 positions that remain 7 after step (ii) (these are the 'newly generated' cells) are filled with a specific `edge_color`.\\n        iv. The `edge_color` is always the color of the cell at `input_grid[R_in_BB][C_in_BB + 4]` (the top-right corner of the input's 5x5 bounding box of non-7 cells).\\n\\n5. **Apply to test input (representative mapping):**\\n- **Step 1: Identify input bounding box and infer shift.**\\n    - The non-7 cells in the test input are: (1,3):5, (1,7):5, (2,4):2, (2,6):2, (3,5):5, (3,7):4, (4,4):2, (4,6):2, (5,3):5, (5,7):5.\\n    - The bounding box for these non-7 cells is from (R_in_BB=1, C_in_BB=3) to (R_in_BB+4=5, C_in_BB+4=7).\\n    - Comparing (1,3) to the shifts: The pattern of shifts has been (0,-1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1). Since `R_in_BB` is 1, a `dr` of `(2 - 1) = 1` for R_out_BB appears to be the logical continuation. For `C_in_BB` = 3, `dc` of `(3 - 1) = 2` for C_out_BB. Let's use the shifts: R_out_BB = min_r_in + dr, C_out_BB = min_c_in + dc. If min_r_in=1, let's assume `dr = 0`. If min_c_in=3, let's assume `dc = -1`. So `(dr, dc) = (0, -1)`. \\n    - Therefore, `R_out_BB = 1 + 0 = 1` and `C_out_BB = 3 + (-1) = 2`. The output pattern's top-left corner will be (1,2).\\n- **Step 2: Determine `edge_color`.**\\n    - `edge_color` is from `input_grid[R_in_BB][C_in_BB + 4]` = `input_grid[1][3 + 4]` = `input_grid[1][7]`, which is 5 (gray).\\n- **Step 3: Apply direct shifts.**\\n    - For each non-7 cell (r,c) in the input, copy `input_grid[r][c]` to `output_grid[r+dr][c+dc]` where `(dr, dc) = (0, -1)`.\\n        - (1,3):5 -> output[1+0][3-1]: `output_grid[1][2] = 5`\\n        - (1,7):5 -> output[1+0][7-1]: `output_grid[1][6] = 5`\\n        - (2,4):2 -> output[2+0][4-1]: `output_grid[2][3] = 2`\\n        - (2,6):2 -> output[2+0][6-1]: `output_grid[2][5] = 2`\\n        - (3,5):5 -> output[3+0][5-1]: `output_grid[3][4] = 5`\\n        - (3,7):4 -> output[3+0][7-1]: `output_grid[3][6] = 4`\\n        - (4,4):2 -> output[4+0][4-1]: `output_grid[4][3] = 2`\\n        - (4,6):2 -> output[4+0][6-1]: `output_grid[4][5] = 2`\\n        - (5,3):5 -> output[5+0][3-1]: `output_grid[5][2] = 5`\\n        - (5,7):5 -> output[5+0][7-1]: `output_grid[5][6] = 5`\\n- **Step 4: Fill remaining template cells with `edge_color`.**\\n    - The 5x5 diamond output pattern (relative to (1,2) in the output grid) is defined by these relative coordinates:\\n      `P_out_rel = {(0,0), (0,2), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,2), (4,4)}`\\n    - Absolute output positions: (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (2,3), (2,5), (3,2), (3,4), (3,6), (4,3), (4,5), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6).\\n    - We check the output grid for these positions:\\n        - `output_grid[1][2]` is 5 (already filled).\\n        - `output_grid[1][4]` is 7 (empty) -> fill with `edge_color` (5): `output_grid[1][4] = 5`.\\n        - `output_grid[1][6]` is 5 (already filled).\\n        - `output_grid[2][3]` is 2 (already filled).\\n        - `output_grid[2][5]` is 2 (already filled).\\n        - `output_grid[3][2]` is 7 (empty) -> fill with `edge_color` (5): `output_grid[3][2] = 5`.\\n        - `output_grid[3][4]` is 5 (already filled).\\n        - `output_grid[3][6]` is 4 (already filled).\\n        - `output_grid[4][3]` is 2 (already filled).\\n        - `output_grid[4][5]` is 2 (already filled).\\n        - `output_grid[5][2]` is 5 (already filled).\\n        - `output_grid[5][4]` is 7 (empty) -> fill with `edge_color` (5): `output_grid[5][4] = 5`.\\n        - `output_grid[5][6]` is 5 (already filled).\\n\\n5. **Verification approach & confidence:**\\n- The predicted output grid would be verified by ensuring all cells outside the determined 5x5 output pattern are 7. Inside the pattern, I would check that all 13 defined positions have non-7 colors, with 10 colors mapped directly from shifted input cells and the remaining 3 filled by the `edge_color`. I am moderately confident in this rule set, especially the `edge_color` derivation, as it consistently explains the extra cells in the examples. The generalization of the `dr, dc` shift for new `R_in_BB, C_in_BB` is the main source of potential error, but the chosen inference (dr=0, dc=-1 for (1,3) input BB) seems consistent with minimizing coordinates for the output pattern's placement.\",\n",
